---------------------------- SDRAM READ/WRITE PIPE -----------------------------

A front-end for the SDRAM controller which allows block reads and writes through
a pair of 16-bit data-valid-ready pipes. Commands and write-data are sent down
the cmd pipe and read-data is returned on the rsp pipe. There is an auto-
increment pointer which is used during read and write operations.

The commands on the cmd pipe look like this:

  CCDD DDDD DDDD DDDD <args>

Where CC:

  00 -> Update pointer with these 14 bits D and the following 16-bits, giving
        a maximum pointer width of 30 bits

  01 -> Read a block of 16-bit words N given by the 14 bits D and the following
        16 bits (max block size 2^30). Subsequently, 2N data bytes need to be
        read from rsp_fifo.

  10 -> Write a block of 16-bit words N given by the 14 bits D and the following
        16 bits (max block size 2^30). Subsequently, 2N data bytes need to be
        written to cmd_fifo.
